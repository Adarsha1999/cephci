The smallest test exection of test / yaml is called fragment 
we can place all the fragments in fragments dir
there are folder available for RGW, RBD, Install and RADOS

Once the fragments are created in this dir, we can softlink 
tests from here to suites/<release-folder> 

Any change in tests defination can be made here and it will 
reflect in all the location whereever this file is linked
