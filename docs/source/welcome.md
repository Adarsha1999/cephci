Welcome to CEPH-CI documentation!
===================================
Ceph-CI is a framework for testing Red Hat Ceph Storage product builds. It
dynamically creates virtual machines and storage volumes within Red Hat's
CentralCI OpenStack environment, installs and tests Ceph, and then de-allocates
the resources when complete.
